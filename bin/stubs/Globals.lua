The sector must be loaded in memory in order for this call to succeed. It will not be loaded from disk or generated. The code will not be run immediately, but it might take up to one update tick until it is run. Therefore, return values of the executed functions will not be retrieved. Due to technical, multithreading-related restrictions, there is no way to check at the time of the call, if the target entity exists in the sector. If it doesn't this call will silently fail. To get an error message printed out on failure as to why it failed, pass 'true' to the 'printErrors' parameter.  This function is only available on the server.
-- @param x - The x-coordinate of the target sector
-- @param y - The y-coordinate of the target sector
